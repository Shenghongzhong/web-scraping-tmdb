# Web scraping popular television shows using Request and Beautiful Soup

## Introduction

The Movie Database (TMDb) is a community-driven website about movies and television shows database. The community has added every piece of data since 2008. Users can search for their desired topics and discover what they like after browsing a large amount of data. Users can also contribute to the TMDb community by giving reviews and their scores to certain shows for the benefits of the community. In summary, TMDb is an excellent website for someone like me who wanted to practice web scraping skills.

## Project motivation
For the purpose of this project, we will retrieve information from the page of ’Popular TV Shows’ using web scraping: a process of extracting information from a website programmatically. Web scraping isn’t magic, and yet some readers may grab information on a daily basis. For example, a recent graduate may copy and paste information about companies they applied for into a spreadsheet for job application management.

## Project goals
The project goal is to build a web scraper that withdraws all desirable information and assemble them into a single CSV. The format of the output CSV file is shown below:
